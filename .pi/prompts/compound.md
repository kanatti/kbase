description: Review session and discuss what to capture in .pi/ files
---

Review our recent work session and **discuss** what learnings to capture in `.pi/` files.

**Approach:**
1. Suggest what patterns/learnings stood out from this session
2. Ask user which ones are worth capturing
3. Discuss where they should go (SKILL.md, new files, etc.)
4. Get user's input on how to frame them
5. Collaboratively update the files

**Focus areas:**
- Development workflows
- Code patterns/idioms
- Testing approaches
- Gotchas and solutions

Don't just update files - have a conversation about what's valuable to preserve.
